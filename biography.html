        <h3>Early Life and Career</h3>
            <p>Achebe grew up in the Igbo (Ibo) town of Ogidi, Nigeria. After studying English and literature at University College (now the University of Ibadan), Achebe taught for a short time before joining the staff of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation in Lagos, where he served as director of external broadcasting in 1961–66. In 1967 he cofounded a publishing company at Enugu with the poet Christopher Okigbo, who died shortly thereafter in the Nigerian civil war for Biafran independence, which Achebe openly supported. In 1969 Achebe toured the United States with fellow writers Gabriel Okara and Cyprian Ekwensi, lecturing at universities. Upon his return to Nigeria he was appointed research fellow at the University of Nigeria and became professor of English, a position he held from 1976 until 1981 (professor emeritus from 1985). He was director (from 1970) of two Nigerian publishers, Heinemann Educational Books Ltd. and Nwankwo-Ifejika Ltd. After an automobile accident in Nigeria in 1990 that left him partially paralyzed, he moved to the United States, where he taught at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. In 2009 Achebe left Bard to join the faculty of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
            <p>Chinua Achebe was born on 16 November 1930 and baptised Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe. His father, Isaiah Okafo Achebe, was a teacher and evangelist, while his mother, Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, was the daughter of a blacksmith from Awka, a leader among church women, and a vegetable farmer. His birthplace was Saint Simon's Church, Nneobi, which was near the Igbo village of Ogidi; the area was part of the British colony of Nigeria at the time. Isaiah was the nephew of Udoh Osinyi, a titled leader in Ogidi with a "reputation for tolerance"; orphaned as a young man, Isaiah was an early Ogidi convert to Christianity. Both Isaiah and Janet stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence, which made a significant impact on the children, especially Chinua. His parents were converts to the Protestant Church Mission Society (CMS) in Nigeria. As such, Isaiah stopped practising Odinani, the religious practices of his ancestors, but continued to respect its traditions due to the influence of his uncle Chief Udoh, who himself refused to convert to the new faith.</p>
            <p>Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe's mother and his sister Zinobia told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books—including a prose adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678). Achebe eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the constant masquerade ceremonies, which he would later recreate in his novels and stories.</p>
            <p>In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School in the Akpakaogwe region of Ogidi for his primary education. Despite his protests, he spent a week in the religious class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting and the best reading skills in his class. Achebe had his secondary education at the prestigious Government College Umuahia, in Nigeria's present-day Abia State. He attended Sunday school every week and the special services were held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe enrolled in Nekede Central School, outside of Owerri, in 1942; he was particularly studious and passed the entrance examinations for two colleges</p>
            <p>—Government College Umuahia and King's College, Lagos—before finally choosing the former. At Government College Umuahia, Achebe was exposed to a rigorous curriculum that included Latin, Greek, and English literature. He excelled academically and developed a deep appreciation for literature, which would later influence his writing style and themes.</p>
        <h3>Major Works and Themes</h3>
            <p>Things Fall Apart (1958), Achebe’s first novel, concerns traditional Igbo life at the time of the advent of missionaries and colonial government in his homeland. His principal character cannot accept the new order, even though the old has already collapsed. In the sequel No Longer at Ease (1960) he portrayed a newly appointed civil servant, recently returned from university study in England, who is unable to sustain the moral values he believes to be correct in the face of the obligations and temptations of his new position.</p>
            <p>In Arrow of God (1964) Achebe returned to precolonial Igbo society to depict the conflict between traditional religion and the new Christian faith. The novel’s protagonist, a tribal priest, resists the changes brought about by the colonial administration and the missionaries but ultimately fails to prevent the disintegration of his community. In A Man of the People (1966) Achebe satirized the post-independence African political scene, portraying a corrupt and self-serving government official who is overthrown by a young idealistic teacher.</p>
            <p>Anthills of the Savannah (1987) is set in an unnamed West African country and explores themes of political instability, dictatorship, and the struggle for power. The novel follows three friends—a government official, a newspaper editor, and a military officer—as they navigate the complexities of their country's political landscape. Through their experiences, Achebe critiques the post-colonial African leadership and highlights the challenges faced by ordinary citizens.</p>
            <p>Achebe's works often explore themes of tradition versus change, cultural conflict, and the effects of colonialism on African societies. He is known for his ability to portray the complexities of African identity and the struggles faced by individuals caught between traditional values and modern influences. Achebe's writing style is characterized by its clarity, simplicity, and use of Igbo proverbs and storytelling techniques, which add depth and authenticity to his narratives.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Achebe received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to literature and his advocacy for African culture. He was awarded the Man Booker International Prize in 2007 and was a recipient of the Nigerian National Order of Merit in 1989. Achebe's legacy continues to influence writers and scholars around the world, and his works remain essential reading for those interested in African literature and post-colonial studies.</p>
