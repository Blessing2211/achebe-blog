        <p>Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian novelist, poet, professor, and critic, widely regarded as the father of African literature in English. Born on November 16, 1930, in Ogidi, Nigeria, Achebe's work focused on the complexities of African identity and the effects of colonialism. His debut novel, "Things Fall Apart" (1958), is considered a classic and has been translated into numerous languages. Achebe's writing often explored themes of tradition versus change, cultural conflict, and the struggle for independence. Throughout his career, he received several awards and honors for his contributions to literature and his advocacy for African culture. Achebe passed away on March 21, 2013, leaving behind a lasting legacy in the literary world.</p>
